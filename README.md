## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Android Studio (And its prerequisites)
Wampserver
ngrok
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Extra files

Put ".php" files from [WAMP files folder of this project](https://github.com/jzrlza/Plant-Soil-B-Plus/tree/master/WAMP%20files) into "D:\wamp64\www" or whatever path you have installed Wampserver.

In the same project folder, use the ".sql" file to create the database with the matching name in "localhost/phpmyadmin" of the Wampserver.

### Test update URL

Using ngrok, it provides the hosting server for the project, but the url of it changes every time it runs.

When opening Android Studio of this project, go to "DynamicURL" class, and you can see the static url value there, once you run ngrok, you'll get the random url code to copy it to the url in this class file. Then run and test as you please.
